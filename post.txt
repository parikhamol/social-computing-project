Advice Please	i'm in my fourth semester of ee now (co-op last spring 2015).   the more i learn programming (not just language wise, but algorithm concepts) by myself on sites like edx and coursera, i lose interest in ee.   i have thought of changing my  major to cs sometimes, but the feeling of wasting my ece credits keep me from that.   i just finished my first co-op term (mostly plc/hmi programming, and database management in sql the whole time). it pays really well. i'm almost certain that my boss wouldn't care if i change my major since he only cares about my potential and aptitudes. they only hire ee for co-op as first though.  minoring in cs is an option, but i really want to avoid taking those ee courses that i have zero interest in like emag, signal and system, electrical energy.  i know for a fact that the knowledge from these course will be useless for me after going out of school and getting into the real world for one semester.   another reason that turn me off on ee is ece2036. i learn nothing from this class. i thought i would learn a lot of programming in this class but i"m so disappointed at the moment by the teaching quality and the structure of the class. clearly my professor cannot teach programming to anybody. i don't understand why he can be a professor when he cannot teach an introduction class like this.   please give me your advice. change it or not? look like i should change it. lol. i guess i'm looking for some encouragement or some buddies that have similar situation. :d

(he's a nice guy anyway).

Here is a more thorough review with some thermal pictures.	overall it's a pretty solid piece of equipment. dell has made a concerted effort to ensure that it supports ubuntu. you can actually get it from dell with ubuntu and not windows. if you do get it with windows you can dual boot it. they lay out how to do it in their forums and continually release patches and updates to keep it running smoothly. it has pretty solid battery life. in power saver mode getting 7 hours out of it is pretty easy. that's with continuous web browsing. if you're doing processor intensive stuff(gaming, 4k video) it's going to last closer to 5 hours. casing on the inside around the keyboard is some sort of carbon fiber/ kevlar composite. it feels soft which is a bit weird. screen looks great. it can technically handle a 3200 x 1800 image but playing video above 1080p and it'll start dropping frames. 2k video still looks good but at 4k it becomes very noticeable. camera location is weird(placed bottom left side). you have to sit slightly off center when using it. they do this to keep the edges of the display extremely narrow. since it doesn't have that huge border between the screen and the side of the case like lenovo or acer the whole thing has almost exactly the same footprint as a macbook air. it's touch screen too but i almost never use it.   http://i.imgur.com/ncvpajg.jpg  this is a second laptop for me. i have a workhorse that drives 3  21' displays with the xps being dedicated to school. overall i'm happy with it. it's light, great battery life, sharp display, big keys that makes it easy to type (even with my lana kane size hands). some people have complained about it getting hot but i really haven't experienced it. here are a couple thermal pictures after playing 4k video for 5 minutes.   http://i.imgur.com/boartjv.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/421t1yp.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/rfomwwt.jpg  it says 92.3 at the vent but it doesn't feel even close to that.  edit: residual heat from my ass on my desk http://i.imgur.com/jsvolvp.jpg . because i can.

(they said on the faq page that they don't care, but i highly doubt that) in another word, does someone attending uiuc have a better chance than uga just because uiuc has a better overall reputation?(under the condition that they are both in engineering program)?   4. are there anyone in gt who transferred from uga(any engineering major)? are there anyone who studied cs at uga and transferred to gt?  5. if you transferred from uga, what was ur gpa?    i have already emailed gt admission office, still waiting for a response, but i still want to hear from the perspective of current students. tuition is not a huge issue but my parents will need to take out loans and i am worried that it is not worth it.  plzzzzz help this kid.......... thank you

Renovations to Van Leer coming!	here's an email i got:  dear ece alumni,  i am very pleased to announce that texas instruments has donated $3.2 million to support the construction of the texas instruments plaza and maker space for the school of electrical and computer engineering.   the plaza and maker space will be located adjacent to and in the van leer building. the most significant change will be to the van leer auditorium, which will be renovated to create a three-level maker space. it will be open to both ece students and students from any major at georgia tech. some conceptual drawings were shown during the ece town hall meeting a couple of months ago.   work on the building design will begin later this summer with an anticipated completion date of late 2016 or early 2017. a previous $2m gift from harris corporation; major gifts from allen ecker (bee 1957 &amp; msee 1958), randy poliner (bee 1977), steve chaddick (bee 1974 &amp; msee 1982), warren batts (bee 1961), alek szlam (bee 1974 &amp; msee 1980), and gene sapp (bee 1959); and donated funds from numerous alumni are making the project a reality. you can read more about the project and see additional conceptual drawings in this institute press release.  van leer plaza conceptual drawing we are not waiting for the new design space to be completed before gearing up our maker-space activities. starting in the fall, we will open up one of the current senior design spaces for anyone on campus to use. modeled on the operation of the georgia tech invention studio, student university lab leaders will staff the lab to assist people with the tools and their designs. the ieee student branch has developed a set of tutorials on embedded systems and will run workshops in that design space, and a vip team is developing some sample open-ended embedded systems projects, guiding students with training modules that put a little more rigor into the hacker mentality. a new sophomore-level elective lab course, practical skills and design, is being offered to teach students how to build their own projects.  the goal is to get our students tinkering early in their gt career. when the doors finally open for the new maker space, we will be ready with trained student university lab leaders, training materials and projects on ece-specific tools and processes, and a student population with the skills and desire to make full use of it immediately.  thank you for your commitment to ece. i look forward to sharing updates on this important project with you as progress is made. to learn more about how you can get involved with the maker space, please feel free to reach out to martina hubbarth, director of development.   sincerely,  steven w. mclaughlin steve w. chaddick school chair and professor

Just received a copyright email from Georgia Tech.	i just received 2 emails for having torrented the 2nd episode of game of thrones this season. i am not on campus and this is my first instance of having been caught. so apparently all georgia tech will do is make sure i delete my torrent client and illegally downloaded stuff before i open a browser on lawn and follow their future instructions (anyone know what these are?) on that.  what worries me is what hbo may pursue to do. both georgia tech and hbo are waiting for me to reply regarding the same and georgia tech mentioned they can't control what hbo would do. hbo has at the moment stated that they just wish me to be punished based on georgia tech's rules which is just temporarily suspending my access but have stated that they are not waiving their rights to pursue more action.  so what should i do? any ideas on what may happen or has anyone experienced this before? any advice would be helpful thanks.

34lj14	05/02/2015 05:40	Starsy	11	37	0	37	Who should be contacted about problems with graduation planning?	i graduated today, and while the majority of the event went fantastically, there were two major issues that had a strong negative effect on the day as a whole:  - the time between phd hooding and phd/masters commencement. i understand why hooding was split into a separate ceremony -- i don't like it, but i understand it. but the problem is that hooding starts at 10am, while commencement ends at 9pm. that's 11 hours from the start of the day to the end of the day. for people in from out of town or people who live too far to drive home in between, that's a long-ass day. why not have them closer together? honestly, if i could do it again, i would have skipped one or the other just because the excessive time between them made it difficult to enjoy the day.  - after commencement, graduating students were shuffled through the tunnel under mccamish to the outside. we weren't permitted to re-enter the stadium, but no one bothered to tell the people on the inside of the stadium that we weren't allowed to reenter. my phone was dead, and my mother and wife wandered around for half an hour trying to find me because no one fucking told them that they had to meet us outside. there were signs that suggested where to gather ("your graduates will meet you outside the west entrance" with no guidance as to which entrance is the 'west' entrance), but we had prearranged where to meet, so they figured we'd stick to our plan. no where was it made clear to those inside the arena that reentering the arena to find your party was forbidden (based on what i heard from multiple people -- obviously, i wasn't in there to know what they were told, but my mother, wife, adviser, and four other people i spoke to had no idea).  - that on its own was poor planning that could have been easily remedied -- just announce "graduates will not be able to reenter the stadium, so please meet them outside." however, what happened as a result was absolute absurdity. there were guards posted at every door to make sure no one came back in when someone was exiting (the doors were locked). on multiple occasions, i saw guards physically grab, push, and verbally accost graduates and their families. one woman, who i believe was in charge (different colored shirt, and the others kept coming to her with questions) pulled a door closed *while someone's arm was in it* to prevent them from coming back in.  it was absolutely absurd. these are families who came to georgia tech to celebrate their kids' and relatives' achievements. these are students celebrating one of the greatest achievements of their lives. and as a university, how do we treat them? like criminals breaking into the stadium to vandalize it or something. we send people to yell at them, physically push and pull them, and treat them like dirt.  it's absolutely absurd what these people put these friends, families, and graduates through today. i don't know who to contact, but i want someone to know what was going on.

33yl17	04/26/2015 21:33	Captain_Awesom	31	3	0	3	Archery Club Practice on Campus	the yellow jacket archery club currently borrows a practice field from gsu. it's hurts our membership because we have to meet at 8am on saturdays to get everyone together and drive to the field. and who wakes up that early on saturday?! we usually have cancellations last minute because people don't want to go wake up that early.  my big question is that we are going to start pushing to be able to practice in burger bowl, which means we would have to close down the center sidewalk for obvious safety reasons. granted we don't exactly have the right to do so, but i don't see another option. if there were signs stating to not use that sidewalk, would you still do it? most people i've asked have said they would walk through anyway. so what are some good ways to stop people from using that sidewalk?  edit 1: i'm mostly here to get feedback. we are actually allowed to practice in the crc in the auxillary gym on the 4th floor some weeknights. it took us about two years to get this practice space, but the problem is that you have to pass a strict test to be able to use that practice range. it takes a person new to archery over 6 moths to succeed.   also, the club has 15-20 nationally certified coaches. so we are well aware of proper procedures and liability. again, i am mostly trying to get a general consensus regarding this idea. we will of course go through proper procedures with crc, gtpd, administration, and legal before we can even consider simply taking over the space.

33v0ce	04/25/2015 22:01	MrThundercock	36	28	0	28	Dear CRC,	i have no problem that you scheduled an elementary-school basketball tournament all day both saturday and sunday that is taking up 4 of the 6 basketball courts, leaving 2 basketball courts for 15,000 undergraduate students + the random family members of the hundreds of kids playing in the tournament.  truly, on this weekend before finals, the most important weekend of the semester, it is a sign of my monumental hubris, arrogance, and unchecked privilege that i would so selfishly expect to be able to relax and engage in physical recreation in a campus facility. as a full time georgia tech student, it is nothing short of laughable that i should waltz into the georgia tech gym and expect to be able to use it. what was i thinking? that i, a georgia tech student paying full fees, have any precedence over young kids at a georgia tech facility i am paying for?  regardless, it's obvious that the management at the crc took great pains to try their hardest to help their students in any way they could on this weekend, the weekend before finals, but this elementary school basketball tournament simply *could not wait*. these are the elite of metro atlanta 5th grade basketball, and to interrupt their international basketball tour by delaying their atlanta tournament by a week, or unthinkably, *two*, is absolutely out of the question.   from the bottom of my heart, i sincerely thank the crc for occasionally not scheduling events that take up the entire basketball courts and letting me, a full-time georgia tech student, use the georgia tech gym, if only once in a while.  --mrthundercock

33n0ve	04/23/2015 21:09	gatechpleasehelp	8	16	0	16	Psychiatry questions	i've been feeling extremely depressed this semester, and i don't think it is stress related. i've had issues with depression and suicidal thoughts before but worked through it on my own, but that 'solution' made me dead inside despite keeping me alive. this semester has been the first time for as long as i can remember where i haven't felt dead inside (and that is great! i actually enjoy things for the first time in forever) but it has come at the cost of wanting to die and being distracted by thoughts of killing myself in varying degrees of intensity and length (there was a good month or so where i was so distracted by it this semester that i learned absolutely nothing in one of my classes throughout that whole time, but other times i feel nothing like that and fully enjoy my time here). i don't want to kill myself and i've decided on a conscious level that killing myself or otherwise dying earlier than my life expectancy would be a negative impact to everyone around me, but these thoughts persist and persist and break me down over and over again.   i want to get help, but i have no desire to speak with friends, family, or my ra about it. i would want to speak with a psychiatrist about these issues, but i want to make sure about a few things before i decide to go to the on campus psychiatric office. i don't want my parents to worry about me anymore than they already do, so i want to make sure that even if i talk about suicidal thoughts at the psychiatric office, they won't notify my parents/the school/whatever. i am also worried about costs that might be incurred by psychiatry sessions. my parents don't have a health insurance plan that covers mental health (and i wouldn't really want to use that plan anyway since they'd be able to see the charges and services) and i am under the impression that we get 2 hours/2 sessions of free counseling a semester as students, so wanted to take advantage of that if it would help me. if the psychiatry here is quality enough to risk them possibly reporting what i say then i will go without hesitation. neither me nor my parents can afford for me to go to many sessions or for me to have a lot of prescription drugs.  because this is something that seems to persist and re-emerge at different times, it would make sense to me that i would be prescribed with antidepressants or the like. this, however, would come into the same issues with the insurance (both that the prescription itself would likely be ridiculously expensive without the right insurance and that the charges if there are any would be known to my parents). if the stamps pharmacy carries antidepressant prescription drugs that i could get without an overly expensive out of pocket, out of insurance charge that would be ideal. i just don't know what i should do.   i want to be clear: i have no intention of killing myself, especially not here at tech, but the thoughts cloud my mind and affect my judgement so i'm scared that i may not be able to hold true to that. i don't believe that these thoughts are being caused by stress from school/finals but stress may be a trigger that causes a cascade of chemical reactions that completely screw my brain chemistry (i don't feel stressed right now, but as i started typing this i was feeling more depressed than i have ever felt before). having some kind of psychological evaluation would help me to better understand what is wrong.  please let me know if you have any information that could help me.  edit:spelling, clarified a thing

(ChBE)	hi r/gatech,  i'm currently a che major currently going to lsu for free and seriously considering transferring to gt. my ap hours should transfer no problem, but i'm concerned about how my che credits will transfer. earliest i can transfer in is next spring, and by that time i will have completed energy/material balances, thermo, fluids/momentum, and the first matlab course. how likely is it that these credits will transfer?   also, on another note, i also want your advice on whether to transfer. i know i want to go to grad school at somewhere great like gt. is it going to be difficult to get admitted to a top-notch grad program with a state university degree? or should i just save my money and stay where i'm at? lsu is just academically unsatisfying and i want to be in an environment like gt, but i'm struggling to decide if it's worth it.

I need you guys.	warning: more of a rant than a question. i'm having a tough night and i seriously need encouragement.  first off, i did search a little and didn't find anything terribly useful for *my* particular concerns, so i figured i'd run the risk of looking like a tool for the potential of you fine people being able to help me/make me feel better cause i'm stressing out hardcore this evening.  i'm a junior^don't ^get ^excited at the university of tennessee chattanooga who has dreams of transferring to georgia tech to get a bachelor's and possibly a master's in computer engineering, then hopefully one day be able to work for nasa or spacex. i want to design things for probes because probes are awesome.  i'm obsessed with the dream of going to tech. i'm doing everything in my power at the moment to get myself there. the only transfer requirement i have to fulfill is the calc-based physics course, which i believe i'll be satisfying at utc over the summer. so i'm hoping to transfer in next spring.  thing is...i'm having a difficult time trying to find classes that 100% transfer. it looks like oscar is still considering the utc curriculum from about five to seven years ago, back when we had fewer class...categories(?) and three digit codes instead of four. i've tried to communicate with various people at tech about classes transferring, but i've been told by every one of them either "that's not my department" or they won't be fully evaluated until i apply, which i can't do until august.  i said "don't get excited" about me being a junior because i still have about two years of classes left at utc if i decide to stay here and graduate. i started college late, i'm 25 now, i estimated that i wouldn't graduate from utc until i was 27. i feel old, and i'm seriously worried that transferring to tech will add on another year or more to that.  however...i want to come to tech because i feel like i would be comfortable stopping with a bachelor's from tech, whereas i would definitely not feel comfortable stopping with a bachelor's from utc. i also want to come to tech because i love atlanta, i love the campus, i've taken tours and heard great things, and - bear with me here - i feel like i belong at tech. i love it and i want to be all up inside it. when i took my last tour in march, i felt a sense of belonging.  but when i look at the required courses and all of my courses that may not transfer, i feel a sense of despair on the level of pitt when they committed their fifth fumble. i don't want to be almost 30 when i graduate. but, it's my life's dream to work for nasa or the like because i'm a massive spacenerd, and surely a degree and the connections made from going to tech will help in that, so...  i mean, all i can do right now is take the summer physics class, apply in august, and hope for the best when my transfer credits are evaluated. since that's the best option for getting myself there, that's what i'll do. i'm just the kind of guy who hates uncertainty and wasted time.  thanks for reading. for the swarm!

E Undergrad doing AE or ME Grad?	so i'm a comp. e undergrad specializing my ece electives in controls. i am thinking of doing a ae or me graduate degree because i would then be better at understanding and coding the controls of vehicles and mechanical systems. i currently have a co-op with an automotive company.     1. who can i talk to about this? because the ece advisors are terrible.   2. should i do me or ae grad? i want to be able to understand mechanical systems of a wide range of vehicles including airplanes, spacecraft, and automotives so that i will be able to program their embedded systems. so which is best?    3. if me/ae is better, which me/ae courses should i take as non-ece electives in my undergrad?    if anyone has thought of or done this path before, please tell me about your experience!!   thank you!

32ouvp	04/15/2015 14:54	____yourcouch	70	131	0	131	My 2¢	tuition goes up every year is not a valid argument. the way it is does not mean it's the way it should be. so everybody saying deal with it need to clam up.  here's the real issue with the tuition hike: 9% is huge. not only that, but tech is receiving the biggest hike of any school in the university system. other usg schools had as little as a 2.5% hike. we are the best institution in the state, and arguably the best in the southeast. at any rate we're the best engineering school in the southeast. we're the pride of the region and we're paying for it. why should we be burdened further because we've dedicated ourselves to our academics.  i'd much rather pay higher taxes when i graduate than go into more debt to finish my degree.  so here's my proposal: the usg board of regents office is right downtown. we can literally walk there. our student body is plenty big to get some real attention. we should have a sit in strike. walk in the building or sit on the lawn and bring shame on the grey-haired politicians who'd rather push the youth into debt than upset their aging, republican constituency.  usg offices address:  270 washington street, sw  atlanta, ga 30334

(cabbagetown, reynoldstown, inman, l5p, candler, decatur, avondale, kirkwood, etc., or also grant park)  preferably, i'd like to live with other students or young professionals in their 20s who are 420 friendly, laid back, enjoy music, intelligent, etc. i'm not intent on being great friends with my roommates, but being able to hang out now and then is definitely a plus.  by the way, i'm male, but i'm open to people of any gender (and i do actually mean any, not "both"). i've lived with women many times before, and frankly the roommates i've had the fewest conflicts with have been unanimously non-male.  my price range would be to go as high $600/mo, but that can vary depending on location (since location will effect how much i need to spend on transportation, too).  i'm open to a group of people/person in an apartment or house with a roommate who is leaving, or a group of people/person who are looking for a place and seeking an additional roommate to join.

BME or MSE?	before you say to major in whichever i'm interested in more, please hear me out!   i have thoroughly explored both majors and figured that i would enjoy them both. i have always wanted to to bme, but recently i have started to have doubts when i learned that they changed the curriculum, eliminating bmed 1000 and making bmed 2210 the first pre-req course that freshman take. did they do this to weed even more people out as bme is becoming a popular major at tech? also, i have been browsing critique.gatech.edu and "the bme unofficial course guide" pdf, and i'm kind of scared by the very low average gpas for some courses. and having a high gpa is necessary to be competitive for med school admissions. that said, i still am very interested in  and would love to do research in this field.   mse interests me because i like applied chemistry and applied physics. i know it's one of the uncommon engineering majors at tech and probably a rare pre-med major. since it's a relatively small major, would it necessarily be easier to develop closer bonds with the professors and potentially help them with their research?  as of now, i want to go into medicine, but that could change, which is why i do not plan to major in a science. i feel that a degree in engineering would be a marketable fallback.   i appreciate insight from any and every gt student/alum, not just bmes and mses. thanks so much!

(georgepburdell@gatech.edu and gburdell3@gatech.edu are the same account)  step three: make amazon id with your alias (georgepburdell@gatech.edu)  step four: free amazon prime for 6 months. enjoy  step five: amazon prime runs out. before they auto-charge you for a renewal, delete that account  step six: make new alias  step seven: repeat from step three till you graduate  step eight: now that you've graduated and cant make more aliases, use your original email (gburdell3@gatech.edu in my case)  i don't use it myself since i have used my alias on resumes and to apply for research positions and i can't delete it without missing future emails sent to it.  if i had used gburdell3@gatech.edu to apply for jobs/research, i could have used this trick.

(any classes i should look out for?)   4. i already learned material up to inheritance/recursion in java through my ap cs a class. i also dabbled in gui's, jframes, gridbaglayouts and such. is there any other topics that you recommend me take on? i have lots of time now so why not.   5. during faset what courses should i prioritize as a tentative cs major? i got accepted to the honors program so hopefully scheduling won't be too tedious.   6. are there threads in the department that focus on game making etc?   7. what classes are required before choosing such a major?      thank you! any help will be appreciated :)

(the common suggestion to move to georgia for a year isn't really an option for me, my parents would never support it).   i appreciate any and all advice!

(marta, morningside, rock springs...?) if so, does the shuttle run at a normal pace, or long stops at each? and finally, do you have to show that you're cross enrolled of dual whateverness to ride?   thanks!
